# Bookmark Notes

A simple web app built with [feature-u] using React.js, redux, and [redux-logic].

It is built to showcase how feature-u helps with feature-based development.

Features are self-contained directories in the `src/features` folder. They are accumulated in the `src/features/index.js` file.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
